# Topic Modeler
The Scandinavian Topic Modeler is a tool developed to topic model Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish corpora. The program was developed by 
Brigham Young University's [Nordic Digital Humanities Lab](https://www.nordicdh.org'). This program is written in Python, and is made possible thanks to Emil Stenstrom's [rippletagger](https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/rippletagger) library and Andreas Mueller's [wordcloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) library.

# Usage
A dmg of the Topic Modeler can be downloaded from [Nordic Digital Humanities Lab](https://www.nordicdh-beta.org/downloads'). For use in an IDE pip install the following dependencies: PIL, PyQt5, rippletagger, wordcloud, gensim, nltk, matplotlib. Some of these libraries may require additional dependencies.
