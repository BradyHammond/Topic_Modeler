# Topic Modeler
The Scandinavian Topic Modeler is a tool developed to topic model Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish corpora. The program was developed by 
Brigham Young University's [Nordic Digital Humanities Lab](https://www.nordicdh.org'). This program is written in Python, and is made possible thanks to Emil Stenstrom's [rippletagger](https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/rippletagger) library and Andreas Mueller's [wordcloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) library.
