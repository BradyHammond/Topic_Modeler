# Topic Modeler
The Scandinavian Topic Modeler is a tool developed to topic model Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish corpora. The program was developed by 
Brigham Young University's [Nordic Digital Humanities Lab](https://www.nordicdh.org').

# Usage
An OSX version of the Topic Modeler can be downloaded from the [Nordic Digital Humanities Lab website](https://www.nordicdh-beta.org/downloads'). At this time, there are not currently compiled binaries for Windows nor Linux. For use in an IDE, use pip to install the following dependencies: PIL, PyQt5, rippletagger, wordcloud, gensim, nltk, matplotlib. Some of the listed libraries may require additional dependencies.
